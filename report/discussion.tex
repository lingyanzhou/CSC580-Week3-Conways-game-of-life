\section{My Rule of the Universe}
Let me explain the rule I create for the universe. Besides alive and dead state, I added three more states. One is growing, one is dying and the other don't-care. Dont'-care state is used for borders and walls. A born and stay-alive condition is a predicate on the number of neighboring alive cells. In my current implementation, the one which produced Figure \ref{fig:r2out}, the born condition is that the 8-connected neighbors have 2 or 3 alive cells. and the stay-alive condition is that the 8-connected neighbors have 2, 3 or 4 alive cells.
The rule set has 7 rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If any born condition is met, a dead cell becomes alive.
\item If any born condition is met, a growing cell becomes alive.
\item If none born condition is met, a growing cell becomes dying.
\item If none stay-alive condition is met, an alive becomes dying.
\item If any stay-alive condition is met, an alive stays alive.
\item If any stay-alive condition is met, a dying cell becomes growing.
\item Otherwise, it will be dead.
\end{enumerate}
The ruleset is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:statemachine}.
