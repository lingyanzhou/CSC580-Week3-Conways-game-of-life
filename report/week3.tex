\section{Reflection}
My program acheives all the goals in the specification. I tested it on some interesting patterns found on the Internet, 
and my program behaved as expected.

The primary difficaulty was debugging. Initially, I cannot visualized the intermediate steps. I finnaly changed the file format
to png, with the help from the ImageReadWrite java class borrowed from CSC508. I can visualize the universe and thus
can find bugs more easily. And with the help from my C++ image processing code in CSC508, implementing border extrapolation
and simulation of the universe was not hard. What's hard is to find an interesting rule. I tried to simply change its 
born/stay-alive rules, say, to B234S234, but most of the time I got a totally random or totally dead universe in the end. However,
I did find an interesting rule.
\section{Interesting Rules}
I think an interesting rules makes the final state of the universe interesting. And an interesting universe should display some
repetitive patterns. For example, using the original rule set, the universe will not end up in a totally chaotic or empty state.
There are patterns like spaceships, sliders, or still lifes. In the universe produced by my ruleset (see Figure \ref{fig:r2out}), the whole universe is a stable pattern. 
\section{Testing My Code}
I tested my code by observing the output. I prepared some input data like spaceships, oscillators and still lifes. These patterns are predictable. I put some of the patterns on the edges so that I can test the border extrapolation functions. Then I run my program step by step and observe their outcomes. I also wrote the intermediate results to files. But the most used method was to create a simple pattern by clicking on the interface and press the "Step" button to see the result. For example, Figure \ref{fig:testing} shows a simple test case and its expected result.

\section{My Rule of the Universe}
Let me explain the rule I create for the universe. Besides alive and dead state, I added three more states. One is growing, one is dying and the other don't-care. Dont'-care state is used for borders and walls. A born and stay-alive condition is a predicate on the number of neighboring alive cells. In my current implementation, the one which produced Figure \ref{fig:r2out}, the born condition is that the 8-connected neighbors have 2 or 3 alive cells. and the stay-alive condition is that the 8-connected neighbors have 2, 3 or 4 alive cells.
The rule set has 7 rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If any born condition is met, a dead cell becomes alive.
\item If any born condition is met, a growing cell becomes alive.
\item If none born condition is met, a growing cell becomes dying.
\item If none stay-alive condition is met, an alive becomes dying.
\item If any stay-alive condition is met, an alive stays alive.
\item If any stay-alive condition is met, a dying cell becomes growing.
\item Otherwise, it will be dead.
\end{enumerate}
The ruleset is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:statemachine}.
